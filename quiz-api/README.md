# Quiz API

Quiz API is a backend service for managing quizzes, users, tasks, reviews, and authentication. It is part of a monorepo called `QuizPlatform`, which also contains the frontend project (`quiz-web`).

This API is built with **NestJS**, uses **TypeORM** for database interaction, and is connected to a **PostgreSQL** database.
